# Infrastructure as Code(IaC)

Before IaC, infrastructure management was typically a manual and time-consuming process. System administrators and operations teams had to:

1. Manually Configure Servers
2. Lack of Version Control
3. Documentation Heavy
4. Limited Automation
5. Slow Provisioning

IaC addresses these challenges by providing a systematic, automated, and code-driven approach to infrastructure management. Popular IaC tools include Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager templates others. 

These tools enable organizations to define, deploy, and manage their infrastructure efficiently and consistently, making it easier to adapt to the dynamic needs of modern applications and services.

# Why Terraform ?

1. Multi-Cloud Support
2. Large Ecosystem
3. Declarative Syntax
4. State Management
5. Plan and Apply
6. Community Support
7. Integration with Other Tools
8. HCL Language
