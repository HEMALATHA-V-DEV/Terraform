# Infrastructure as Code(IaC)

Before IaC, infrastructure management was typically a manual and time-consuming process. System administrators and operations teams had to:

1. Manually Configure Servers
2. Lack of Version Control
3. Documentation Heavy
4. Limited Automation
5. Slow Provisioning

IaC addresses these challenges by providing a systematic, automated, and code-driven approach to infrastructure management. Popular IaC tools include Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager templates others. 

These tools enable organizations to define, deploy, and manage their infrastructure efficiently and consistently, making it easier to adapt to the dynamic needs of modern applications and services.

# Why Terraform ?

1. Multi-Cloud Support
2. Large Ecosystem
3. Declarative Syntax
4. State Management
5. Plan and Apply
6. Community Support
7. Integration with Other Tools
8. HCL Language

# key terminology and concepts. Here are some fundamental terms and explanations.

Provider: A provider is a plugin for Terraform that defines and manages resources for a specific cloud or infrastructure platform. 

Resource: A resource is a specific infrastructure component that you want to create and manage using Terraform. Resources can include virtual machines, databases, storage buckets, network components, and more. 

Module: A module is a reusable and encapsulated unit of Terraform code. Modules allow you to package infrastructure configurations, making it easier to maintain, share, and reuse them across different parts of your infrastructure. 

Configuration File: Terraform uses configuration files (often with a .tf extension) to define the desired infrastructure state. These files specify providers, resources, variables, and other settings. The primary configuration file is usually named main.tf, but you can use multiple configuration files as well.

Variable: Variables in Terraform are placeholders for values that can be passed into your configurations. They make your code more flexible and reusable by allowing you to define values outside of your code and pass them in when you apply the Terraform configuration.

Output: Outputs are values generated by Terraform after the infrastructure has been created or updated. Outputs are typically used to display information or provide values to other parts of your infrastructure stack.

State File: Terraform maintains a state file (often named terraform.tfstate) that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure. This file is crucial for Terraform to understand what resources have been created and what changes need to be made during updates.

Plan: A Terraform plan is a preview of changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure. When you run terraform plan, Terraform analyzes your configuration and current state, then generates a plan detailing what actions it will take during the apply step.

Apply: The terraform apply command is used to execute the changes specified in the plan. It creates, updates, or destroys resources based on the Terraform configuration.

Workspace: Workspaces in Terraform are a way to manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with separate configurations and state files. Workspaces help keep infrastructure configurations isolated and organized.

Remote Backend: A remote backend is a storage location for your Terraform state files that is not stored locally. Popular choices for remote backends include Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HashiCorp Terraform Cloud. Remote backends enhance collaboration and provide better security and reliability for your state files.

These are some of the essential terms you'll encounter when working with Terraform. 

# Setup Terraform for AWS

To configure AWS credentials and set up Terraform to work with AWS, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**

Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed on your machine. 

2. **Create an AWS IAM User**
   
3. **Configure AWS CLI Credentials**

Use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials. Open a terminal and run:

```
aws configure
```

It will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and default output format. Enter the credentials you obtained in the previous step.
